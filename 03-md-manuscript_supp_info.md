# Supplementary Text

## Note S1: Extended Methodology
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Unlike the main text, here we provide the raw data derivation. The western blot analysis is shown in **@Fig:s1** and primer sequences are listed in **@Tbl:s1**. These data complement the results shown in **Figure 1** of the main manuscript. The methodology follows established protocols [@smithDeepTissueImaging2024; @doeQuantumCoherence2025].

## Note S2: Additional Controls
Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Representative histology samples are presented in **@Fig:s2**. Additional validation experiments were performed according to recent guidelines [@chenSenescencePathways2025]. Statistical analysis followed the protocol described by [@wilsonStatisticalMethods2023].
